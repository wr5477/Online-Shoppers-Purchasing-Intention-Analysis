## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes online shopping behavior data to understand what factors influence a user's purchasing decision.  
Using exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques, we examine customer behavior patterns and build predictive models for purchase intention.

This was a **team-based final project** completed as part of a **University of Texas at Austin course**, following the official course syllabus and requirements.

## 🎓 Academic Context
- **Institution:** The University of Texas at Austin  
- **Course:** Elements of Statistical Machine Learning  
- **Project Type:** Final Course Project (Team-Based)

The project was designed to demonstrate the application of statistical learning techniques covered in the course, including data preprocessing, feature analysis, classification models, and model evaluation.

---

## ❓ Research Questions
The project was structured around three main research questions:

1. **Which user behavior features are most influential in determining purchase intention?**  
2. **Can we accurately predict whether a user will make a purchase using machine learning models?**  
3. **How do seasonality and behavioral patterns segment users into distinct groups?**

## 📊 Dataset
**Source:** UCI / Kaggle – Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset

The dataset contains session-level data from an e-commerce website, including:
- User browsing behavior (page visits, duration)
- Traffic source and visitor type
- Temporal features (month, weekend)
- Purchase outcome (Revenue)

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
Data preparation was a critical component of this project and included:

- Handling missing and inconsistent values  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Feature scaling and normalization  
- Creating cyclical representations for temporal variables  
- Preparing clean datasets for modeling and clustering

## 🧠 Modeling & Analysis

### 🔹 Research Question 1: Feature Importance
We explored relationships between user behavior variables and purchase outcomes using:
- Correlation analysis
- Tree-based feature importance
- Model interpretation techniques

---

### 🔹 Research Question 2: Purchase Prediction
Multiple classification models were evaluated to predict purchase intention, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting-based models

Model performance was compared using appropriate evaluation metrics to address class imbalance.

### 🔹 Research Question 3: Seasonality & Customer Segmentation
We analyzed seasonal effects on purchasing behavior and applied clustering techniques to segment users based on behavioral patterns.
